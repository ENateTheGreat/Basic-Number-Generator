# Basic-Number-Generator

This is a static JavaScript number generator that generated the first 100 numbers and color codes them by even, odd, and prime.

In this I used JavaScript for the generation and sorting of numbers as well as styling them, HTML for the basic structure of the page, and CSS for small styling and display setup.

The initial challenges I faced in making this was creating a function that sorted the numbers and appended the color codes properly.

This was a challenge in the 30DaysOfJavaScript by Asabeneh, and I do not have any plans to implement more functionality in the future.

To run this application, download the 3 files and then open a live server through your preferred IDE.
